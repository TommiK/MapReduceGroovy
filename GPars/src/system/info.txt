I tried to solve the following problem:


There is a list of users.
Each User has a sequence/list of Places he has visited in the past 
A place in the Sequence is represented by just an id(int). So one place can occur several times in the sequence.

Now I want to determine how often each place has been visited.
 The main requirement is to exploit parallelism.
How can I improve the Code? Any better ideas. I compare concurrency frameworks and want to do little benchmarking 
(I know that is very difficult on the JVM) but I am very new to Groovy, so I want to ensure the code is good (fast).

Thank you.
